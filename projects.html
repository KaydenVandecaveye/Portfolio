                <h2>Chess (Terminal to UI Upgrade)</h2>

                <h4>Description:</h4>

                <p>This project began as a terminal-based chess game developed as part of an assigned project from CSCI 1933. The core functionality, 
                    including basic game rules and player moves, was implemented using Java's terminal interface. 
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Following the initial version, I expanded on the project to include a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. 
                    This upgrade enhanced the user experience, allowing players to interact with the game through a visual board and even log their
                    moves! In addition to the GUI, I also implemented more comprehensive chess rules such as castling, 
                    en passant, pawn promotion, and check and checkmate detection. 
                </p>

                <br>  

                <p>    
                    I focused on modular code architecture by designing reusable components 
                    like pieces, boards, and moves, adhering to object-oriented principles. This project not only helped refine my Java 
                    skills but also showcased my ability to handle both front-end and back-end development.
